## 12 Principles of Animation

### Squash and Strech:

- Depending on what something is made of, object deform under motion.
- Squasing and Streching gives the illusion of weight and volume to an object or character as it bounces or otherwise moves. For example, when a ball bounces it'squashed as it hits the ground and streches as it heads upward

- On the web, it could be a button depression before the start of the more extensive animation that starts when the button is selected
